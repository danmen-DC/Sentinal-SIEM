# Sentinal SIEM
## Objective

The Sentinal SIEM project aimed to establish a controlled environment within Azure for attracting and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs using microsoft Sentinal. The Honeypot gathers test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
